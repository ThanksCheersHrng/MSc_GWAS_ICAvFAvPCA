# My MSc paper 
considered three methods of dimensionality reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA, commonly used), Factor Analysis (FA), and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) as potentially appropriate methods for reducing the noise in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). To my knowledge, PCA is the long-standing approach for genomists, and my paper, under the guide of my project advisor, Dr. James Bentham, may be one of the first to attempt to apply ICA to the same task. To this repo I have uploaded the final paper in pdf form for anyone who's curious; the necessary code is shown therein, in screenshots. However, to upload the entire project, with all backing data, resource reading, experimental R files, experimental Python files, experimental Plink Files, txt files with ideas, and image files, would be painful for both of us. Let's not go there. If you have any questions about the project, feel free to contact me, bearing in mind it was some years ago I produced this work, and I may not be able to answer your questions. Obviously, if you're working on your own bioinformatics project, you are also welcome to check out any of the references in the bibliography, and I wish you luck!
